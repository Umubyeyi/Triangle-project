# Project name:Triangle-project
#### By ** UMUBYEYI Dinah **
## Description 
My-project-portfolio ,is about to describe A triangle and its type. a triangle is a plane created by connecting three points. The first two arguments specify the first point, the middle two arguments specify the second point, and the last two arguments specify the third point.

Equilateral triangle:In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.

Isoscele triangle: Isosceles triangle. ... In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.
scalene triangle: A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.

          <h3>Isoscele triangle</h3>

         <p>Isosceles triangle. ... In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. </p>
         <p> Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length,</p>
         <p> and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.</p>
         
         <h3>Equirateral triangle</h3>

               <p> In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. </p>
                <p>In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular;</p>
                <p> that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.</p>

                <h3> scalene triangle</h3>

           <p> A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides, such as those illustrated above.</p>
